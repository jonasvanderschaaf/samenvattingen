\subsection{General Probability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\ee(X)$: Expected value of X.
    \item $\pp(X)$: Probability of X.
    \item $\pp(X\mid Y)$: Probability of X given Y.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Game Theory}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A$: Set of actions.
    \item $a$: a action in $A$; an action profile.
    \item $\alpha$: an action profile.
    \item $\mathcal{B}_i$: Best response for player $i$.
    \item $\mathcal{B}_i(a)$: Best response for player $i$ for the action profile $a$.
    \item $N$: a set of players.
    \item $u_i(a)$: Utility (payoff) for player $i$ with action profile $a$.
    \item $U_i(a)$: Expected payoff for player $i$ with mixed action profile $a$.
    \item $P(A) = 1$: Player function. When the history is $A$, it is $1$'s turn.
\end{itemize}
